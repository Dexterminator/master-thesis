In this chapter, the results of the experiments are outlined, in the form of benchmark tables and plots.

\section{Transformation benchmarks}
The benchmarks for the experiments are outlined below. For each dataset, the results consist of a table containing
speedup, real time, user time, system time, and memory usage for each worker number. The standard deviation is represented
as a value following the $\pm$ sign. The value S in worker column signifies the original sequential program, while 1 is the
parallel program with a single worker. In addition to the tables, the real time, speedup, and memory usage are illustrated
using plots in order to visually demonstrate how the values change with the number of workers. In the plots for real time
and memory usage, the standard deviation is illustrated using black bars above and below each data point\footnote{
The standard deviation is shown for all plots of real time and memory usage, but it may be too small to be seen for some of the plots.}.
